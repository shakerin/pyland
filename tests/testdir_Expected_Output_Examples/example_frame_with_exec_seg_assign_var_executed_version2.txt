Programming language: PYTHON

This is one EXAMPLE class.
In this class of EXAMPLE, we are going to 
check if internal frames work within EXAMPLE.

we can keep executable segments below.
The arrows below represents code segment. 
Anything type between them will be executed 
in python.

I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class1
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class2
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class3
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class4
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class5
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class6
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class7
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class8
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class9
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class10


for now, there is a predefined variable that must
be used for returning any value.

You can create FILE using valid PYTHON code

I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class1

I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class3
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class4
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class5
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class6
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class7
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class8
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class9
I am a txt generated from EXAMPLE class10
