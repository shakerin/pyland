Name: $name
Anything: $anything : it can be any word
Programming language: $language

This is one $name class.
In this class of $name, we are going to 
check if internal frames work within $name.

we can keep executable segments below.
The arrows below represents code segment. 
Anything type between them will be executed 
in python.

<<<
for i in range(10):
    self.txt += "I am a txt generated from $name class" + str(i+1) + "\n"
>>>

for now, there is a predefined variable that must
be used for returning any value.

You can create $anything using valid $language code

<<<
for i in range(10):
    self.txt += "I am a txt generated from $name class" + str(i+1) + "\n"
>>>

<<<
for i in range(10):
    if i==9:
        self.txt += "I am a txt generated from $name class" + str(i+1) + "\n"
>>>
