This project aims to enable anyone to create a text generator+automator for themselves.

* **Text Generator** is something that can generate bunch of text files(with code or any 
type of text in it) and directories based on minimal user inputs.

* **Automator** is something that can execute any script based on certain inputs from
user or any equivalent system.

Users need to follow instruction as mentioned in this readme to leverage the power of pyland.
