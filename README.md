Coding Guideline:

Comment:

Class method docstrings should contain the following:

    - A brief description of what the method is and what itâ€™s used for
    - Any arguments (both required and optional) that are passed including keyword arguments
    - Label any arguments that are considered optional or have a default value
    - Any side effects that occur when executing the method
    - Any exceptions that are raised
    - Any restrictions on when the method can be called
